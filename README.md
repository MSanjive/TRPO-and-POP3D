# TRPO-and-POP3D
This project explores advanced methods and/or applications in Reinforcement Learning. In this project, Proximal Policy Optimisation and a variant of Trust Region Policy Optimisation (TRPO) - Policy Optimisation with Penalised Point Probability Distance (POP3D) was used to train the LunarLander and CartPole environment from the OpenAI Gym.
